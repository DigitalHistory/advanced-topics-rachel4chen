# **The Expansion of Toronto Churches**

## *Map Setup*

This map of downtown Toronto churches will examine the most popular churches in to analyze what correlation there is between the year they were established and their locations. The methodology of this research is admittedly imperfect, but I chose the churches with at least 30 different ratings on Google maps, under the assumption that those are the most attended churches in Toronto. St. Michael’s Cathedral Basilica had the most ratings with 110, and the Metropolitan United Church had the minimum required for consideration at 30 ratings. The red markers indicate if a church was built before the twentieth century, and blue markers indicate churches built in the twentieth century.

## *Background History*

In 1893, Toronto was called “a city of churches” ([Caulfield 4](http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A150918750/AONE?u=utoronto_main&sid=AONE&xid=014bf17a)). There were 90 churches then, but in 1995, researcher Jon Caulfield found that only 29 of them still served as churches ([3](http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A150918750/AONE?u=utoronto_main&sid=AONE&xid=014bf17a)).  There are multiple theories on why the religious usage of large historical churches have declined in use, including secularization, landscape theory, and land use planning guidelines ([Hackworth and Gullikson  74-75](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00083658/v57i0001/72_gnmtrccrasit.xml)).

The theory of secularization is self-explanatory, it implies that as society becomes less religious, the need for churches decreases. As a result, cities begin to look to other ways to utilize the space.  For example, it has become common in big cities like Toronto for companies to buy out churches and repurpose them into lofts. The appeal of repurposing churches comes from a desire to preserve those with “a clear heritage identity” if they can “fit a normative ideal of modern upscale loft living” ([Lynch 194](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/14036096/v31i0002/192_dlmascalitc.xml)). If, however, churches cannot fit those two criteria, the incentive to preserve the buildings falls unless they continue to have an active congregation.

Landscape theory claims that churches are a reflection of the current landscape. It implies a direct correlation between the number of churches in a city and the religiosity of a city ([Hackworth & Gullikson 74](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00083658/v57i0001/72_gnmtrccrasit.xml)). In Toronto, under this theory, the fall from 90 of the original 1893 churches being active to only 29 in Caulfield’s study could indicate that the city population has become much more secular. However, this theory is reductive. It does not account for other factors that cause church congregations to move out of the city.

Another study, conducted by Jason Hackworth and Erin Guillikson looks further into the legal and economic reasons on why churches could be on the decline in Toronto. They note that the city of Toronto aimed to intensify development, and increase affordable housing ([78](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00083658/v57i0001/72_gnmtrccrasit.xml)). Due to the combination of these goals and rising costs for living downtown, “mainline Protestant urban congregations are struggling for membership” ([75](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00083658/v57i0001/72_gnmtrccrasit.xml)). For some churches, this means that they sell their buildings either entirely, or convert part of the churches into mixed-use buildings with both housing and religious services ([79](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00083658/v57i0001/72_gnmtrccrasit.xml)).  

Additionally, after 1893 there was a “phase of industrialism”, which caused a growing middle-class to move out to the suburbs. Church congregations followed, also leading to a decline in churches downtown ([Caulfield 12](http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A150918750/AONE?u=utoronto_main&sid=AONE&xid=014bf17a)).  

## *Map Interpretation*

In this map, the location markers show a clear divide between nineteenth century churches and twentieth century churches. Out of Toronto’s most ranked churches, the older ones fall on the eastern side of Spadina Avenue, with the oldest church – the Cathedral Church of St. James – prominently set in the area known as Old Toronto. All of the newer ones, St. Patrick’s Catholic Church, the Holy Trinity Russian Orthodox Church, and Russian Orthodox Christ the Saviour Cathedral, spread northwest of Old Toronto.

Although there are older churches outside of Old Toronto, such as Our Lady of Lourdes, the way that newer churches were built further west from Toronto as the city grew, corroborates the movement of citizens to the suburbs. Notably the two that are located furthest west – the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian Orthodox Christ the Saviour Cathedral – also represent a newer denomination, likely spurred by later Russian immigration waves to Canada.

Considering the history of Toronto’s religious community and studies on the supposed increase in secularization, the fact that Russian Orthodox churches were established further also indicates that religion is not necessarily on the decline. As one scholar noted, where “religious entrepreneurism” is allowed to thrive, religion tends to be more likely to thrive ([Hackworth & Gullikson 73](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/00083658/v57i0001/72_gnmtrccrasit.xml)). With more diversity in church denominations, this map reaffirms the idea that religion may just be on the move, as it expands to areas less steeped in the tradition of one denomination.

Regarding the older churches that still have active congregations, such as those in the Old Toronto area, it is likely that they were able to maintain their buildings downtown

## *Conclusion*

Regarding secularization downtown, Hackworth and Gullikson’s study appears to be confirmed. Older churches that managed to stay functioning as churches are generally in areas with more foot traffic, due to their proximity to popular tourist spots. For example, St. Basil’s Catholic Parish at the University of St. Michael’s College is located on the University of Toronto. With such a popular location, its survival is indicated by the 110 ratings it has on Google, in comparison to the church out in Humewood-Cedarville, which only has 38 in comparison. When tourism and heritage value exist, it is less likely for a church to be converted into mixed usage spaces.

Unfortunately, because this map is very simple, the markers merely indicate dates. A more complex map, with different layers for the churches’ years of establishment, number of ratings, and denominations would give a more in depth look at how those factors correlate. It would be interesting to see how ratings correlate to denominations, and how years of establishment are related to denominations. As the map stands, it is at the very least clear that newer churches reflect the movement of their congregations further out of the Toronto downtown core.
