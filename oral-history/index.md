Scientists only discovered Auto Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) and Human Immunodifiency Virus (HIV) in the 1980s ([AVERT](https://www.avert.org/professionals/history-hiv-aids/origin)). As a result, the disease was widely misunderstood. When Tom Graziano and his wife first adopted their son John, they did not know why he was always sick. Doctors also could not understand why ([Paul Nilsen and Tom Graziano](https://storycorps.org/listen/paul-nilsen-and-tom-graziano-151204/)). It turns out that he had contracted HIV “from his biological mother” ([Nilsen and Graziano](https://storycorps.org/listen/paul-nilsen-and-tom-graziano-151204)).

In the audio clip, John’s elementary principal, Paul Nilsen, and John’s father, Tom, discuss how their suburban town reacted to John’s diagnosis. From the beginning, Tom points out that even John’s doctor was afraid of AIDS (<a href="https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/graziano1.mp3" onclick="javascript:seek(10)">seek to 0:10</a>). Globally, this reaction reflects the reluctance of health experts to address the AIDS crisis in a timely manner. The primary focus of World Bank’s World Health Organization (WHO) was “its neo-conservative health reform package” rather than dealing with the HIV epidemic ([“Editorial” 235](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/13685031/v65i0003/233_thcatrth.xml)). By not prioritizing AIDS, the WHO set a low global standard and other government groups, such as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), were slow to act as well ([Brier 971](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). In their slow responses, there was time for confusion to grow amongst the public, and this would prove a challenge for families of children with AIDS.

There were quite a few barriers to children with AIDS, in large part due to the stigma attached to the disease. In a way, John was lucky that Paul was so open to keeping John in school (<a href="https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/graziano1.mp3" onclick="javascript:seek(26)">seek to 0:26</a>). When the AIDS epidemic hit and it became known that children were also affected, the CDC eventually released recommendations for children with AIDS. They said, “the benefits of an unrestricted setting would outweigh the risks of their acquiring potentially harmful infections in the setting,” meaning that affected students should be allowed to attend school [Brier 970](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf). However, the “qualified language” of the CDC left room for terrified parents to doubt the validity of recommendations to mainstream children with AIDS ([971](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). For example, one of the sentences in the CDC recommendation admitted that studies on the risk of transmission through fluids from “children who lack control of their body secretions” was “limited” was not very reassuring to terrified parents ([970-971](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)).

Although the CDC clarified that students would only be admitted to schools if a physician has deemed it okay, parents were quick to assume that the recommendations meant any student could attend ([971](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). As a result, parents often protested.  In a specific case study of the Queens community, in New York City, for example, parents responded to the admittance of a student with AIDS through protests and calls to other parents to keep their children at home ([965](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). In John’s case, the audio clip does not indicate any protests to the same extent.

However, Paul mentions parents trying to ask him which student had AIDS (<a href="https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/graziano1.mp3" onclick="javascript:seek(75)">seek to 1:15</a>). Likely, the parents thought that knowing which student had AIDS would allow them to keep their child away from the disease because they were uninformed on how AIDS functioned. The difference between AIDS and HIV were not very clear outside of the scientific sphere, and confusion over the two added to the stigma ([Brier 972](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). Coverage of AIDS inadvertently conflated gay bathhouses with the school issue as well, further confusing parents about how AIDS would impact their children in public spaces ([973](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). Government policies did not help either. Reagan’s Domestic Policy Council was famously conservative, and erred on the side of parental fears ([971](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). The rhetoric in public discourse surrounded ‘protecting’ unaffected children, with little understanding of what they were supposedly protecting their children from ([974](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)).  Parents focused on the idea of “common sense” rhetoric, with parents claiming to understand children better than the CDC. They were concerned that children would have nosebleeds, vomit, or bite each other because children have less control over their own bodily functions ([975](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf)). Overall, all these concerns were blown out of proportion.


Eventually in Queens, parental protests were quelled during a legal suit, when Dr. Polly Thomas testified, asserting that she was both a mother and a scientist and then proceeded to explain that children biting each other posed little risk of AIDs transmission [Brier 978-979](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf). This spurred education advocacy to prepare parents and teachers with accurate information about AIDs [980](http://muse.jhu.edu.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/article/200128/pdf). Fortunately, John had support from the other students, and Tom thanks Paul that John was able to love his school (<a href=" https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/graziano1.mp3" onclick="javascript:seek(75)"> seek to 1:32</a>).
In the audio clip, Paul acknowledges that error too, when he admits that at first the school was very cautious with John (<a href="https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/graziano1.mp3" onclick="javascript:seek(46)">seek to 0:46</a>). These reactions largely came from adults, however. At John’s school, the children were “very protective” (<a href="https://storycorpsorg-staging.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/graziano1.mp3" onclick="javascript:seek(69)">seek to 1:04</a>). In one study of children in South Africa, children were as aware as adults of the stigmas that were associated with AIDS. In interviewing children for the study, they found that the children’s responded with compassion and a desire to help people with HIV. One child suggested sharing food and drinks, another suggesting “saying nice things about them” ([Bhana 733](https://journals-scholarsportal-info.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/pdf/13691058/v10i0007/725_bsycrthaa.xml)).
